## Features
Our free Instagram Followers Scraper allows you to scrape profile information from Instagram. Just add one or more Instagram usernames to get data on all users that follow them.

## Why scrape Instagram Followers?
This data can give you valuable information about popular users anywhere in the world, help you predict trends, track brand awareness, learn how to improve your Instagram performance, or just keep an eye on competing influencers. This can also help you build you audience by targetting the users interested in your area of expertise.

## Do you need other data from Instagram?
You will most likely be able to get them using the [Instagram Scraper](https://apify.com/jaroslavhejlek/instagram-scraper). It is a very complex tool so it can do virtually anything (but it is also more difficult to set up). 

Let us know if you need a [custom Instagram scraping solution](https://apify.com/custom-solutions).

## How much will it cost me?
Apify provides you with $5 free usage credits to use every month on the [Apify Free plan](https://apify.com/pricing) and you can get more then 1000 followers from this Instagram Followers scraper for $5. So it will be completely free for 1000 results!

But if you need to get more data regularly you should grab an Apify subscription. We recommend our [$49/month Personal plan](https://apify.com/pricing) - you can get more then to 10,000 followers every month with $49 in monthly usage credits from that plan! And if it is still not enough, [$499/month Team plan](https://apify.com/pricing) will bring you over 100k followers.

## Is it legal to scrape Instagram?
Our Instagram scrapers are ethical and do not extract any private user data, such as email addresses, gender, or location. They only extract what the user has chosen to share publicly. We therefore believe that our scrapers, when used for ethical purposes by Apify users, are safe. However, you should be aware that your results could contain personal data. Personal data is protected by the [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) in the European Union and by other regulations around the world. You should not scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so. If you're unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers.
