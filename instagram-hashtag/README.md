## Is it legal to scrape Instagram? 
Our Instagram scrapers are ethical and do not extract any private user data, such as email addresses, gender, or location. They only extract what the user has chosen to share publicly. We therefore believe that our scrapers, when used for ethical purposes by Apify users, are safe. However, you should be aware that your results could contain personal data. Personal data is protected by the [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) in the European Union and by other regulations around the world. You should not scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so. If you're unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers. You can also read our blog post on the [legality of web scraping](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/).

## Cost of usage
There are two main factors to take into account if you want to run one of our Instagram scrapers on the Apify platform:
- [Compute units](https://apify.com/pricing/actors) - used for running the scraper
- [Residential proxy traffic](https://apify.com/pricing/proxy) - needed to access Instagram without login

### Using proxies
Instagram now aggressively blocks scrapers and redirects them to a login page. The only reliable solution to this problem is to use residential proxies. Datacenter proxies only work in rare cases.

### Residential proxies
Instagram scraper is free to use, although you will need to use [residential proxies](https://apify.com/proxy?pricing=residential-ip#pricing) on [Apify Proxy](https://apify.com/proxy) if you run it on the Apify platform. This is because Instagram changed the rules in 2021 and now you always need to use a residential proxy for scraping. Luckily, every new Apify account includes a small free trial of residential proxies, so you should be able to test any of our Instagram scrapers.

### Custom proxies
You can also use proxies from other providers in the custom proxies fields (`proxyUrls` in the JSON settings).

### Cost of usage breakdown
Scraping 1,000 Instagram posts will cost you just $4.25 platform credits from your [Apify subscription plan](https://apify.com/pricing).

Scraping **1,000 posts** requires about:
- **5 compute units**
- **0.24 GB of proxy traffic**

### Example pricing
Based on Apify's pricing at the time of writing, scraping **1,000 posts** would cost 5 CU * $0.25 + 0.24 GB * 12.5 GB, which is a total of **$4.25**. The Apify Personal plan ($49) would allow you to scrape about 11,500 Instagram posts monthly.

## Input parameters
The input of this scraper should be JSON containing the hashtag or list of hashtags that should be visited. Required fields are:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| hashtags | Array | (required) Hashtags to search on Instagram |
| resultsLimit | Integer | How many posts should be loaded from each hashtag (limit is per hashtag) |

## Scrolling through large profiles or posts
Instagram imposes rate limits that will block scrolling if you want to scroll for more than 1,000 posts or comments. To work around this issue, the scraper starts injecting randomized wait times once you reach 1,000 posts or comments. This is configurable by means of the `scrollWaitSecs` input parameter. If you get the message that you were rate limited, consider increasing this parameter for the specific profile or post.

### Instagram hashtag scraper input example

```jsonc
{
    "hashtags": ["apify", "webscraping"],
    "resultsLimit": 100
}
```

## During the actor run
During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what's going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently being scraped. When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page, in most cases.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with a failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## Instagram output format
The actor stores its results in a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any language (Python, PHP, Node.js/NPM). See the [Apify API docs](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2) to learn more about getting results.

The structure of each item in Instagram posts when scrolling looks like this:
